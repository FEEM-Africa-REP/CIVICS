# REP_CVX: A Python Module For **SUT IO** Analysis

Developed by [Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei](https://www.feem.it/en/)

The classes and tools in this module should work with any Supply and Use table following the structure defined in the tutorial.

The main class of the module "C_CUT" :
    
The calss has multiple typical tools for input-output analysis:
    
    1. Calculating all the matrices of flows and coefficients from a given database
    2. Implementing shocks 
    3. Sensitivity Analysis on the shocks
    4. Policy impact assesment
    5. Visualizing results and generating reports
    
## Data storage
